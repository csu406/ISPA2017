<p class=MsoNormal><strong>Panel Discussion:</strong> Achieving Trustworthy Cyber Systems: Challenges and Strategies</p>
<br>
<p class=MsoNormal><strong>Abstract.</strong>
    <span>With the rapid progress of information technology and its extensive applications in our daily lives, the quality of cyber systems is becoming more critically important than ever.  The increasing pervasiveness and intelligence of various  smart devices, various increasingly powerful computing systems and networks, as well as the availability of big data and various machine learning techniques have been used to constitute the cyber systems and infrastructures, which we have to heavily rely upon now and more in the future for various services.  How to achieve trustworthy cyber systems is a major objective for researchers and practitioners. </span><br><br>
    <span>The panelists in this panel have diverse background with outstanding research accomplishments are invited to present their opinions on the challenges and strategies to achieve the objective of having trustworthy cyber systems.  The session will then be open for discussions from the floor.</span>
