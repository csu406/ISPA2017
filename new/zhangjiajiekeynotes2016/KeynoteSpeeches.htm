    <strong>Title</strong>:  Flow-Net Accountable Logging and Applications<u> </u>
	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accountability implies that any entity should be held responsible for its own specific action or behavior so that the entity is part of larger chains of accountability. One of the goals of accountability is that once an event has transpired, the events that took place are traceable so that the causes can be determined afterward. The poor accountability provided by today's computers and networks wastes a great deal of money and effort. This is due to the simple fact that today's computing and network infrastructure was not built with accountability in mind. In this talk we introduce our previous work: accountable logging methodology called flow-net. We apply this methodology to many applications ranging from operating system design to computer networks.</p>

    <strong>Title</strong>:  Attribute-Based Access Control Status and Directions<u> </u>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  Attribute-based access control (ABAC) appears to be a promising direction for futuristic applications. ABAC encompasses almost existing access control models, including Identity-Based Access Control, Role-Based Access Control. In this talk, we will look at two ABAC research efforts, namely, eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) and NIST Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) and provide a detailed comparison.  We will demonstrate how these approaches satisfy the needs of some applications, including policies in the health care sector.  We will also provide pointers to the open problems and some directions for future research in ABAC.

    <strong>Title</strong>:  Algorithmic Crowdsourcing: Current State and Future Perspective<u> </u>
	<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  This talk gives a survey of crowdsourcing applications, with a focus on algorithmic solutions. The recent search for Malaysia flight 370 is used first as a motivational example.  Fundamental issues in crowdsourcing, in particular, incentive mechanisms for paid crowdsourcing, and algorithms and theory for crowdsourced problem-solving, are then reviewed. Several applications of algorithmic crowdsourcing applications are discussed in detail, with a focus on big data. The talk also discusses several on-going projects on crowdsourcing at Temple University.</p>

    <strong>Title</strong>:&nbsp; Architecture Consideration for Big Data Processing
	<p> <strong>Abstract</strong>:&nbsp; With emerging of big data, the processing speed for the data is one of the key issues for big data technology. One of the efficient way to handle the velocity of data is putting all the data in the memory. But traditional memory, DRAM, consumes a large amount of energy and cost to build a large memory system. In recent years, lots of non-volatile memory devices, such as phase change memory (PCM), are studied to be part of memory. We call these storage class memory (SCM). Combing traditional memory and SCM together to build a large hybrid memory space is becoming one of the energy-efficient way to extend the traditional in-memory computing system into a new level, to handle large quality of data in real time. In this talk, we will discuss this new in-memory computing system from different aspects and some challenges in this new system. We will also report some ongoing effort in China to build this hybrid memory-based in-memory computing system, and some latest advances in this area.</p>

    <strong>Title</strong>:&nbsp; Security Protocols Fit for Humans
	<p> <strong>Abstract</strong>:&nbsp; Many security protocols involve humans, not machines, as endpoints. The differences are critical: humans are not only computationally weaker than machines, they are naive, careless, and gullible. We present foundations, methods, and tool support for formalizing and reasoning about security protocols used by fallible humans. We provide case studies of authentication protocols that show how different protocol constructions and features differ in their effectiveness with respect to different kinds of human errors. This provides a starting point for a fine-grained classification of security protocols from a usable-security perspective.(Joint work with Sasa Radomirovic and Lara Schmid)</p>

    <strong>Title</strong>:&nbsp; Thrifty Zero-Knowledge: When Linear Programming Meets Cryptography
	<p> <strong>Abstract</strong>:&nbsp; We introduce "thrifty" zero-knowledge protocols, or TZK. These protocols are constructed by introducing a bias in the challenge sent by the prover. This bias is chosen so as to maximize the security versus effort trade-off. We illustrate the benefits of this approach on several well-known zero-knowledge protocols.</p>
